<H2>Getting started</H2>

0. Read prerequisites

1. Download the latest release or download "configfile.py" and "sniping_bot.exe" from the repository.


2. Open "configfile.py" (with notepad for instance) and add your ethereum address and personal key at the bottom of the file between the quotation marks(''). You can also define how many threads you want running at once (=how many instances of the bot at once). The latter option can not be changed within the GUI. Please note, that the bot will buy multiple times when more than 1 thread are used.

<pre>...
threads='1'
my_address = ''
my_pk = ''</pre>


3. Run "pancakesniper_demo.exe"

- Make sure configfile.py and bot.exe are in the same folder.


4. Edit settings according to choice.
